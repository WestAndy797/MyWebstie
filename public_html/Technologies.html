            HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages.

            HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like html).<br >
            HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like, although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example img.<br > 
            The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second h1 and /h1 nd tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).<br >

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.<br > While most often used to style web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document,<br > including plain XML, SVG and XUL. CSS is a cornerstone specification of the web and almost all web pages use CSS style sheets to describe their presentation.
